            <h2>So, Who am I</h2>
            <p>I am a muslim. I have been lived in Bangladesh my whole life. I am a part of a four memeber family. Among
                four members, two are my parents and my little brother Sakib and I are the other two members of the
                family. <br>
                Currently I am pursuing my honors degree in <a href="https://www.du.ac.bd/academic/department_item/POPS"
                    target="_blank">Population sciences</a> at <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Dhaka" target="_blank">
                    University of Dhaka.</a> The University provided me with the opportunity to live in a hall named
                Bijoy Ekattor as a resident student.
                <br>
                Some of my favorite places in my campus:
            <ul>

                <li>In front of senate building. I love spending time here while the area is quiet!</li>
                <li>Garden of Jashimuddin Hall. I often spend some quality time here.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What I do enjoy</h2>
            <p>I love craeting things in programming language that add values in people's lives. Well, to do that I have
                to be very good in several programming languages. That's why I have been learning some languages
                including Python, JavaScript, PHP etc.</p>
